# Adventure_Game
In this project I had to create a text style video game that would

- give the players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- something different happens depending on the choice the player made. 
- the game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
- the game has conditions for winning and losing.
- when the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.

imported modules used

-time / used for time.sleep() inorder to create a delay between messages for dramatic effect.
-random / used for random.choice inorder to change the enemy everytime the game is played between the three black figure, serial killer, and zombie.

also used a tool called pycodestyle that checks your python code against some of the style conventions in pep8.
